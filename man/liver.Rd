\description{
A total of 186 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were recruited
at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals in 2017. The patients underwent
computed tomography scan of the liver for the presence of non-alcoholic
steato-hepatitis, the most severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
The image was subsequently assessed by two radiologists using a scale of 1
to 5, with higher values indicating greater likelihood of disease.
